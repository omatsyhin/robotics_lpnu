# Robotics Introduction Labs

Completed tasks for labs that are part of Intro to Robotics subject in Lviv Polytechnic National University. If you want to complete the tasks from scratch you can access [the original repo](https://github.com/RybOlya/robotics_lpnu).

## Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 24.04** (native, WSL2, dual boot, or VirtualBox)
- **Git** and **GitHub account** - [GitHub Hello World Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)
- **30 GB free disk space**
- **8 GB RAM** (16 GB recommended)

**Don't have Ubuntu 24.04?** See the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions.

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/omatsyhin/robotics_lpnu.git
cd robotics_lpnu
```

### 2. Build Docker Image

```bash
./scripts/cmd build-docker
```

This takes 10-15 minutes on first run.

### 3. Run Container

```bash
./scripts/cmd run
```
### 4. Install and open VScode

```bash
code .
```


#### Open Additional Terminals

```bash
# In a new terminal window
./scripts/cmd bash
```

## Labs

| Lab | Topic | 
|-----|-------|
| **[Lab 1](lab1/README.md)** | Building a Robot in Gazebo |
| **[Lab 2](lab2/README.md)** | ROS2 Integration |
| **[Lab 3](lab3/README.md)** | Moving Mobile Robots in Simulation |

### Development Workflow

**The typical development cycle:**

1. **Edit files** on your host machine (outside container) using your favorite IDE
   - Files in `/home/YOUR_USER/robotics_lpnu/` are automatically visible inside container at `/opt/ws/src/code/`

2. **Enter container** (if not already inside):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cmd bash
   ```

3. **Build your code** inside container:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

4. **Run and test** inside container:
   ```bash
   gz sim worlds/robot.sdf        # For Lab 1
   ros2 launch lab2 ...            # For Lab 2
   ```

5. **Repeat** steps 1-4 as needed

**Important**: Changes to files are instant (no rebuild needed for world files, Python changes need rebuild).

### Useful Workspace Commands

```bash
# Build only specific packages
colcon build --packages-select lab1

# Build with symbolic links (faster for Python)
colcon build --symlink-install

# In case of building at wrong level for example - clean workspace (remove build artifacts)
rm -rf ./build ./install ./log
```

**Note:** After cleaning, you must rebuild with `colcon build` before running any ROS2 commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker permission denied
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### GUI not working
```bash
# Linux: Allow X11 connections
xhost +local:docker

# WSL2: Update WSLg
wsl --update
```

### Container won't start
```bash
# Remove inactive containers
docker system prune -a
./scripts/cmd build-docker
```

### ROS2 commands not found / Package issues
```bash
# Try re-sourcing the environment
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source /opt/ws/install/setup.bash

# Or restart the container
exit
./scripts/cmd run
```
